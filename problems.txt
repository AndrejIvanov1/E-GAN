Problems: 
1) Dataset iterator is not meant to be called in every iteration
2) Discriminator activation function ? Nothing vs softmax vs sigmoid


Tasks:
- Implement diversity fitness score
- Visualise discriminator in tensorboard

Future tasks:
1) Parallelize children operations in EGAN



Findings: 
tf.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(Dgz), Dgz)
				 SAME AS
-tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(tf.nn.sigmoid(Dgz)))
				 SAME AS
		    E[log(Dgz)]


tf.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy(tf.zeros_like(Dgz), Dgz)
				SAME AS 
	-tf.reduce_mean(tf.log(1 - tf.nn.sigmoid(Dgz)))
				SAME AS
			E[log(1 - D(G(z)))]
